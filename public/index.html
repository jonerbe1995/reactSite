    <p>Currently a 5th-year Senior majoring in Communication Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I have taken several rigorous classes and have been developing my knowledge and skills outside of the class room. These extracurriculars include my employment with Epistemic Analytics as well as my executive position of President for my school’s Software Development Club. The courses I have completed have given me a solid foundation in the tools, processes and methodologies involved in the successful development and analysis of programs. I have a proven ability to learn challenging concepts quickly and have developed competencies in diverse areas. My goal is to develop secure and robust websites and programs that advance innovative projects. I carry a drive for programming as well as managing programmers; working in a collective that will make consistently excellent code.

    <p><span class="w3-large w3-margin-right">Cody Marquart</span> Techincal Director at Epistemic Analyitcs. </p> 
    <p>As the Technical Director at Epistemic Analytics, I have managed Jon Erbe for over three years. As Jon's responsibilities grew within the group, his adaptability and organization greatly developed along with it. He is very detail-oriented and quick to learn something new. Early in his employment, Jon provided live support to users of our virtual internships. He helped students, mentors, and teachers with any questions they had, while escalating issues when necessary. Jon exceled at this, monitoring numerous games simultaneously. However, I quickly saw his
motivation and willingness to do much more.
Within the first year, he was applying the knowledge obtained from assisting the virtual internships
towards acting as a key member in the quality assurance phases in our development cycle. His
attention to detail was well-suited for this, as it’s important to catch issues in the software early on. His
participation, paired with his full understanding of our software, proved vital in our ability to provide
users with stable software. Additionally, he learned to query our databases and organize the data collected from the virtual internships. His organization of data was crucial, as the data is used by graduate students, research staff and principal investigators in dissertations, quantitative research and journal articles. Job duties aside, in the lab, Jon is easygoing and, as a team-player, fit well in our collaborative environment. He has worked with many co-workers on a variety of tasks, while developing autonomy to work without explicit instruction. Overall, I highly recommend Jon for employment. His demeanor and ability to adapt to new tasks, coupled with his attention to detail and organized nature make him well-suited for most any work
environment.</p><br>

    <p><span class="w3-large w3-margin-right">Ellery Kreloff</span> Data Engineer, Senior Associate at Capital One.</p>
    <p>I have worked alongside Jon for two years in the Software Development Club as its chapter's president.
It is my pleasure to recommend him for a full-time position with your organization.
Jon's pure dedication and commitment fueled his rise up through our ranks. In four short semesters, he
went from just a simple member, to outreach chair, to vice president, to the president after my leave. He
is always outspoken, unafraid to voice his opinions and concerns, and always the first to volunteer to
take up extra work.
When our website needed a redesign, Jon was there to assist in any way that he could. He beta-tested
our site on his own free time: testing responsiveness, trying URLs that didn't exist. Due to his expertise,
we were able to overhaul our entire site. He also contributed to our code base, unafraid to learn technologies and concepts with which he was unfamiliar. I would describe his technical aptitude as
excellent. During our club meetings, Jon is easygoing and friendly. With our sponsors, he builds up an easy rapport due to his natural charisma. Despite his amicable attitude, he can be nonetheless firm: always ensuring that our club meetings started on time and that our students were quiet. Overall, I highly recommend Jon; his natural skill and organized nature would make him a first-rate
employee.</p>
